## Heart Disease Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Project Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a heart disease dataset.
The objective is to identify demographic and clinical factors associated with the
presence of heart disease using descriptive statistics and data visualization.

This project is designed as a beginner-to-intermediate level data analysis portfolio
using real-world healthcare data.

### Dataset
- **Name**: Heart Disease Prediction Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Format**: CSV
- **Records**: 270 patients
- **Features**: 14 variables (demographic & clinical)

#### Target Variable
- `Heart Disease`
  - `Presence` → Patient has heart disease
  - `Absence` → Patient does not have heart disease

### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Google Colab
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

### Analysis Performed
The following analyses were conducted:

- Distribution of heart disease cases
- Age vs heart disease analysis
- Gender vs heart disease analysis
- Cholesterol comparison
- Blood pressure comparison
- Maximum heart rate (Max HR) analysis

### Key Findings
- Patients with heart disease tend to be older
- Male patients show a higher proportion of heart disease
- Cholesterol and blood pressure are higher among patients with heart disease
- **Max HR shows the strongest distinction**, where patients with heart disease have
  significantly lower maximum heart rates

### Conclusion
The analysis indicates that heart disease is associated with a combination of
demographic and clinical factors. Among all variables, maximum heart rate appears
to be the most informative indicator in distinguishing patients with heart disease.
This project demonstrates the value of exploratory data analysis in healthcare data
before applying predictive modeling.
