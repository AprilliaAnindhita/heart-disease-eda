## Heart Disease Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Project Overview
This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a heart disease dataset with the aim of identifying key demographic and clinical factors associated with the presence of heart disease.
The analysis utilizes descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques to uncover patterns and relationships within real-world healthcare data.

This project is designed as a beginner-to-intermediate level data analytics portfolio, demonstrating fundamental skills in data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and insight generation using Python.

### Dataset
Name: Heart Disease Prediction Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Format: CSV
Total Records: 270 patients
Features: 14 variables (demographic and clinical attributes)

### Target Variable
- Heart Disease
    * Presence → Patient has heart disease
    * Absence → Patient does not have heart disease

### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Google Colab
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

### Analysis Performed
The following exploratory analyses were conducted:
1. Distribution of heart disease cases
2. Age comparison between patients with and without heart disease
3. Gender-based heart disease analysis
4. Cholesterol level comparison
5. Blood pressure (BP) comparison
6. Maximum heart rate (Max HR) analysis

### Key Findings
- Patients diagnosed with heart disease tend to be older on average
- Male patients show a higher proportion of heart disease compared to females
- Cholesterol and blood pressure levels are generally higher among patients with heart disease
- Maximum heart rate (Max HR) shows the strongest distinction, where patients with heart disease tend to have significantly lower maximum heart rates

### Conclusion
The exploratory analysis indicates that heart disease is associated with a combination of demographic and clinical factors.
Among all variables examined, maximum heart rate emerges as the most informative indicator for distinguishing patients with heart disease.

This project highlights the importance of exploratory data analysis in healthcare analytics as a critical step before applying predictive or machine learning models.

### Interactive Dashboard (Tableau)
An interactive dashboard was developed using Tableau Public to visually summarize and communicate the key findings from the analysis, including:

- Distribution of heart disease cases
- Age comparison by heart disease status
- Gender-based heart disease patterns
- Maximum heart rate differences
